# Bluetooth Compass Project
This project is a personal showcase of my skills in PCB design, embedded firmware development, and Android application programming—centered around a custom-built Bluetooth-enabled digital compass.
I created this project as a demonstration of my capability to design and manufacture a clean, self-contained PCB solution, free from the reliance on off-the-shelf BLE modules. It’s a manifestation of my passion for building systems from scratch, with a focus on RF design and embedded software.

## 🛠️ Hardware Overview
- Microcontroller: Nordic nRF52832 with integrated BLE support
- Antenna: Custom-designed meandering line antenna tuned to 2.4 GHz
- Magnetometer: QMC5883L for 3-axis magnetic field sensing (I2C communication)
- LEDs: 12x Blue LEDs in a circular layout to represent compass directions and 6x Status LEDs: USER, CONNECTIVITY INDICATOR, HEARTBEAT
- Battery: CR2032 coin cell slot
- Programming Interface: SWD (SWCLK, SWDIO), UART connector
- Clock: 32 MHz external crystal for BLE SoftDevice
- PCB Stack: 4-layer custom design, credit-card sized

The reset pin is repurposed as a user input button. The reset functionality is disabled in software to allow this.

## 🔧 Firmware Overview

Firmware is built on Zephyr RTOS, enabling modular and modern embedded software design.
A custom Bluetooth service, CompassService, is implemented, exposing three key characteristics:

- Button State
- User LED Control
- Direction Output

### 📡 Magnetometer Integration
- QMC5883L communicates over I2C.
- Each axis (X, Y, Z) is read as a signed 16-bit value using: 
```
int16_t value = (MSB << 8) | LSB
```
- Orientation is computed using the X and Y components:
```
float angle_rad = atan2f((float)mag_y, (float)mag_x);
float angle_deg = angle_rad * (180.0f / M_PI);
if (angle_deg < 0) angle_deg += 360.0f;
```

The direction value is then:
- Broadcast over BLE using notify characteristics
- Rendered via LEDs in a circular fashion to act as a real-time compass

The system runs on the internal RC oscillator, while the external crystal is reserved for BLE operations.

## Visit Card features
- User button
- Powered with CR2032 battery
- Bluetooth connectivity
- Magnetometer / compass with HMC5883L IC
- Array of1 12 circulary arranged LEDs to be used as compass
- Array of 6 linearly arranged LEDs to be used for custom needs
- Exposed programming pads
- Exposed UART pads

Visit Card has meandering line antenna for bluetooth connectivity.

To reduce cost, component count and layout space, microcontroller uses internal RC oscilator.
Board is designed as a 4 layer board with stackup:
- Top and bottom layer are signal layers
- Power plane and ground plane are the two middle layers

# nRF Connect notes

## How to program the board

[nRF52 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52-DK) can be used to program the visit card. 

nRF Visit Card board has exposed pads that are used for programming.

### Pinout

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e94f38-904f-421a-b804-ea394c2b5d63)

## Internal oscilator enable

To enable internal oscilator for nRF52832 in the proj.conf file add:
````
CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC=y
CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_500PPM=y
CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_RC_CALIBRATION=y
CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_CALIBRATION_LF_ALWAYS_ON=y
````

## Enable rest pin to be input GPIO

In the overlay file add:

```
&uicr {
	/delete-property/ gpio-as-nreset;
};
```

after it make sure to call:

```
nrfjprog --eraseuicr
nrfjprog --program <path to hex file> --verify
```

 You might need to reset the board after this - unplug it and plug it back in.

## If _printk_ is not working
In the proj.conf file add:
````
CONFIG_CONSOLE=y
````
## Disabling NFC pins
Pins P0.09 and P0.10 are NFC pins and if you wan't to use them as GPIO pins you need to disable NFC.
[nrf52 enabling gpio on nfc pins](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/35505/nrf52-enabling-gpio-on-nfc-pins)
```
CONFIG_NFCT_PINS_AS_GPIOS=y
```

## Enable printing via SWD IO and SWD CLK
In the proj.conf file add:
```
CONFIG_LOG=y
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=n
CONFIG_RTT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y
```
then you can use `printf` function.
```
uint16_t a = getAzimuth();
printf("Azimuth: %d\n", a);
```
Make sure to connect to RTT (Real-Time Transfer).
